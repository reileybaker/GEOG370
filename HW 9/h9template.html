<h1>Homework 9: Make a Choropleth or Proportional Symbol Map </h1>
<h2>Reiley Baker</h2>
<h3>This map displays data collected by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) in 2018 on each state's energy-related carbon dioxide emissions, divided by the state's population. I chose this dataset because energy use and subsequent emissions are an interesting topic to me, and I was curious as to how this data would look if normalized to account for the number of people in each state; per capita energy use emissions are a more accurate indicator of each individual's impact on carbon dioxide emissions, and would be more useful in the public policy realm for passing air pollution and climate change legislation. </h3>
